# FentonStokesClass

This is a C++ code for the Fourier, 7th-ordered Stokes, and 5th-order Cnoidal nonlinear water wave theories. The implementation is based on the orighnal plan-C code of Fenton (http://johndfenton.com/Steady-waves/Fourier.html). 

For the Stokes solution, it is extended from the 5th-ordered solution of Fenton (1985) to a 7th-ordered one based on a symbolic computation.

And for the Fourier and  5th-order Cnoidal waves, they are simply objected-oriented revisions.
