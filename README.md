# FentonStokesClass

This is a C++ code for the Fourier, 7th-ordered Stokes, and 5th-order Cnoidal nonlinear water wave theories. The implementation is based on the original plan-C code of Fenton (http://johndfenton.com/Steady-waves/Fourier.html). 

For the Stokes solution, it is extended from the 5th-ordered solution of Fenton (1985) to a 7th-ordered one based on a symbolic computation.

And for the Fourier and  5th-order Cnoidal waves, they are simply objected-oriented revisions.

Features:

1. the input and output are kept the same as those of the original version

2. global variables are removed compared with those in the original version.

3. the three theories are combined into one framework.

4. it is possible to add other solution.
